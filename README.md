## Understanding the various pre-processing steps which is required in Machine Learning before a Model is built.

Steps Performed:
1. Checking the distribution of each variables using describe()
2. Checking Skewness
3. Transforming the variable using sqrt/log10 to remove outliers.
4. Using Random Forest for Variable selection: Method RFECV for chossing the most important variables 
5. Applying Logistic Regression
